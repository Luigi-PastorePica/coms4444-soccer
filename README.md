</p>

The project involves a retroactive soccer league. The league has 10 teams, each competing to rank as highly as possible after playing once against every other team. Following conventional soccer leagues, a win counts for 3 points, a draw is 1 point, and a loss earns 0 points. The first round of the league is randomized, and you have no control over the outcome. The simulator will look at each of the 45 games and assign a random number of goals to each team in each game. The
number of goals scored comes from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, where each of the nine games for a team uses exactly one element of this set. The outcome of all games can be computed based on the goals for each team, and the teams can then have their point totals calculated. Teams are then ranked from 1 to 10 based
on the point totals. At this point, you can reallocate your goals subject to a set of constraints (see the project on the course website for these constraints). This reallocation is iterated over *r* rounds, where *r* is relatively large. Your teamâ€™s point score and rank are computed at the end of each round, and the average rank over all rounds will be called the **final rank**. Your goal for this project is to get as high a final rank as possible.

## Required Installations
Before you can start working with the simulator and implementing your code, you will first need to set up your environment.

### Java
The simulator is implemented in Java, and you will be required to submit your project using Java. If you do not have Java set up, please follow these instructions:

### Git
Version control with Git will be a large aspect of team-oriented development in this course. You will be managing and submitting your projects using Git. Mac and Linux users can access Git from their terminal. For Windows users, it is preferrable to use a common emulator like "Git Bash" to access Git.

Please follow these instructions for installing Git and forking repositories:

1.  Make sure you have Git installed. Instructions on installing Git for your OS can be found at: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
2.  You will need to set up SSH keys for each machine using Git, if you haven't done so. To set up SSH keys, please refer to: https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent. Note that you only need to complete the subsection titled _Generating a new SSH key_ for your OS.
3.  Add your newly-generated SSH keys to the GitHub account, as done here: https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.20/user/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account.
4.  Fork any repository (to fork, click on "Fork" in the top-right of the page), and clone the forked repository in your local machine inside the parent directory that will house the repository (to copy the remote URL for cloning, click on the "Clone" button, make sure that "Clone with SSH" is visible - the remote URL should start with `git@github.com` - and copy the URL to the clipboard). You should now be able to stage, commit, push, and pull changes using Git.

## Implementation

You will be creating your own player that extends the simulator's abstract player. Please follow these steps to begin your implementation:
1.  Enter the `coms4444-soccer/soccer` directory, and create a folder called "g*x*" (where *x* is the number of your team). For example, if you are team "g5," please create a folder called "g5" in the `soccer` directory.
2.  Create a class called `Player` inside your newly-created folder, and copy the following code into Player (the TODOs indicate all changes you need to make):

```
// TODO change the package name to reflect your team
package soccer.gx;

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

import soccer.sim.Game;
import soccer.sim.GameHistory;

public class Player implements soccer.sim.Player {

     private int teamID, rounds, seed;
     private Random random;
     
     /**
      * Player constructor
      *
      * @param teamID  team ID
      * @param rounds  number of rounds
      * @param seed    random seed
      *
      */
     public Player(int teamID, int rounds, int seed) {
          this.teamID = teamID;
          this.rounds = rounds;
          this.seed = seed;
          this.random = new Random(seed);
     }

     /**
      * Reallocate player goals
      *
      * @param gameHistory      cumulative game history from all previous rounds
      * @param playerGames      state of player games before reallocation
      * @param opponentGameMap  state of opponent games before reallocation (map of opponent team IDs to their games)
      * @return                 state of player games after reallocation
      *
      */
     public List<Game> reallocate(GameHistory gameHistory, List<Game> playerGames, Map<Integer, List<Game>> opponentGameMap) {
          // TODO add your code here to reallocate player goals
          
     }
}

```

## Submission
To submit your code for each class and for the final deliverable of the project, you will create a pull request to merge your forked repository's *master* branch into the TA's base repository's *master* branch. The TA will merge the commits from the pull request after the deliverable deadline has passed. The base repository will be updated before the start of the next class meeting.

## Simulator

#### Steps to run the simulator:
1.  On your command line, *fork* the Git repository, and then clone the forked version. Do NOT clone the original repository.
2.  Type `cd coms4444-soccer` to enter the repository.
3.  Run `make compile` to generate the make file.
4.  Update the make file with the set of teams participating in the game.
5.  Run one of the following:
    * `make run`: view results/rankings from the command line
    * `make gui`: view results/rankings from the GUI

#### Simulator arguments:
> **[-r | --rounds]**: number of rounds

> **[-p | --players]**: space-separated players/teams

> **[-t | --simTime]**: specified time for simulation runs

> **[-s | --seed]**: seed value for random player

> **[-l | --log]**: enable logging

> **[-v | --verbose]**: flag for recording verbose log during games when logging is enabled

> **[-g | --gui]**: enable the GUI

> **[-f | --fps]**: speed (frames per second), only for the GUI
